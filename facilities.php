                <p>At BHAWAS ACADEMY, we understand that the admission process can be a
                    daunting task for parents. That's why we have designed a hassle-free process that accommodates the
                    urgent needs of our parents. We ensure that all your questions are answered to your satisfaction
                    before
                    initiating the registration and admission process. We also provide ample time for parents to procure
                    the
                    necessary documents and submit them for the completion of the appropriate paperwork. We believe that
                    the
                    admission process should be effortless and quick, and we strive to provide our parents with the best
                    possible service.
